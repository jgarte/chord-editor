============

__Work In Progress__

Provide a simple UI in order to generate chord diagrams like this:

The idea comes after a late night conversation over a glass of whisky with felespiller [Sturla Eide](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturla_Eide) who needs something similar for his guitar teaching. He also needed similar patterns for bass:

and piano:

To build
--------

    bower install
    npm run build

and then navigate in your browser to /dist.  The browser must support web-audio if you wish to hear the chord.
